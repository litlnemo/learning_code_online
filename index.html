      Code learning sites and apps: June 24
    </title>
  </head>

    <h1>Code Learning Sites and Apps: June 2024</h1>

    <p class="plain">I am about a month into my recent attempt to get back into coding 
    and get further than I ever did before. In the process, I am using a variety 
    of websites and apps to teach, motivate, and give me practice opportunities. 
    I’m reviewing them to help others who might be in my position, and because I’m 
    interested in instructional tech. This is a bit long, so hang on!</p>

    <h2>My context</h2>
    
    <p class="plain">I’m not completely new to coding. I taught HTML and CSS for 15 years at 
      the college level, but that job ended some years ago (the school actually 
      went out of business shortly afterwards, for good reason, but that’s another 
      story entirely).</p>

    <p class="plain">However, HTML and CSS aren’t exactly the same thing as other programming. 
      In a sense, it’s just formatting. I wanted to learn to program. After I left 
      the teaching job, I enrolled in the Web Technology Solutions certificate 
      program at the University of Washington. This involved learning JavaScript, 
      MySQL, and php. I completed the cert. At the same time, I was studying Python 
      through a Rice University course on Coursera. I made an Asteroids game in 
      Python! </p>
      
      <p class="plain">But then… I didn’t get a job using any of these skills. And I forgot most 
        of it,  the same way you can forget your high school foreign language 
        skills if you never use the language after you graduate. And in the 
        meantime, technology advanced. Python is now Python 3. HTML/CSS practices 
        have shifted. So I found myself in 2024, annoyed with myself for having 
        forgotten so much, and looking for affordable ways to get it back… and beyond! 
        Here’s what I’ve been trying so far.

<h2>“Duolingo” Apps</h2>
<p class="intro">A common design now is the “Duolingo” type app. So far, these don’t involve a ton of 
code writing, so I am doubtful they can be a standalone solution, but they do help 
keep code alive in your head for one more day every time you use them, so they 
have their value. They tend to have “streaks” and leaderboards, just like Duolingo,
so if these work for you, here they are! Each also has a free level, which is 
ad-supported in some cases.</p>

<div id="bubble">
<h3 class="pixelify">Sololearn, <a href="https://www.sololearn.com">https://www.sololearn.com</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Free with some limits.</li>
  <li>Pro ($12.99/month, $69.99/year) has unlimited hearts, bonus exercises, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Works well, and I find the free version is fine for me at this stage. The Pro 
version gives some more exercises but I don’t feel they add enough value at 
this stage.</p>

<p><strong>Full learning paths:</strong> Coding Foundations, Web Development, Python Developer, 
Coding for Data, Front-end for Beginners. Courses include tons of languages, 
including C, Java, C++, JavaScript, etc. They also have courses focused on 
generative AI.</p>

</div>

<div id="bubble">
<h3 class="pixelify">Mimo, <a href="https://mimo.org">https://mimo.org</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Free “forever” on mobile. The first few lessons are free via web browser.</li>
  <li>Pro ($12.49/month, $99.99/year) adds certificates and unlimited hearts.</li>
  <li>Max ($39.99/month, $299/year) adds full access via the web, not just mobile, 
and an AI tutor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The free level is OK. It is frustrating to be mobile-only once you finish the 
early lessons, because sometimes they want you to type code in and I really 
dislike coding on mobile. But, it’s free. The main problem is the cost to be 
able to use your laptop or desktop computer. You have to have the Max plan, 
which is $$$$! I don’t feel the added value is worth the cost. The lessons are 
fine but I would not pay for either the Pro or Max levels.</p>

<p><strong>Career paths:</strong> Full-stack, front-end, Python. Courses include HTML, CSS, SQL, 
Swift, JavaScript, Python.</p>

<div id="bubble">
<h3 class="pixelify">Encode: Learn to Code, app on iOS and Android</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Free with some limits. Ad-supported.</li>
  <li>Encode Plus ($9.99/month, $29.99/year) adds unlimited hearts, no ads, 
    learn offline</li>
</ul>

Very similar to the previous two, but the price is better. Has the usual 
“Duolingo”-type features. 

<p><strong>Paths:</strong> Learn to Code, Swift, Command Line, Make a Website, Analyze Data,
  SQL, Java. Courses include all the above (including Python, HTML, CSS), plus R.</p>

/>
</div> 
<h2>Show-and-Type Lessons</h2>

<p class="intro">“Show-and-type” lessons are the next step above the Duolingo-type apps, and it’s a 
pretty big step! These apps tend to have a built-in IDE and terminal in which you 
can create actual programs, guided by lessons with working examples, and working 
up to completing full programs by yourself.</p>

<div id="bubble">
<h3 class="pixelify">Codecademy, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">https://www.codecademy.com/</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Free basic access to certain courses.</li>
  <li>Plus ($29.99/month, $180/year) adds more courses, personalized practice, skill 
paths, certificates.</li>
  <li>Pro ($39.99/month, $240/year) adds a bunch of career-related resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can’t say much about Codecademy because I haven’t been using it recently. 
  I used it many years ago and loved it — back then, it was completely free, which 
  was a bonus! A lot may have changed since then — it looks to me like much of what 
  made Codecademy great is locked behind the paywalls now. Worth trying out to see 
  if it works for you and if you feel the price is worth it.</p>

<div id="bubble">
<h3 class="pixelify">Codédex, <a href="https://www.codedex.io">https://www.codedex.io</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Free “Forever” access to early chapters, lots of projects, community.</li>
  <li>Club member ($9.99/month, $84/year) adds all features including certificates, full 
courses, project reviews, AI, code mentors, etc.</li>
  <li>Club 4 Life ($299 one-time) adds a rare badge and lifetime access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Codédex is unusual in specifically targeting Gen Z, though others are welcome too. 
Its retro-video-game style is actually pretty good at targeting Millennials and 
GenX as well.  A strength of Codédex is the community, which is pretty active and 
quite helpful. If you are a club member, you can turn in projects that get reviewed 
by Code mentors with legit feedback. I do kind of worry about scalability as the 
site grows, but right now it’s great. Flaws here seem to be partially growing 
pains — things not quite fully baked yet (like some courses not having certificates 
yet, or the badges being kind of minimal — could they use the Open Badges format, 
maybe?), but it’s got a lot of personality (Tamagotchi, anyone?) and the price is 
exceptionally good for what you get.</p>

<p><strong>Courses:</strong> Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git & GitHub, React, SQL</p>

<div id="bubble">
<h3 class="pixelify">CodeSignal, <a href="https://learn.codesignal.com/">https://learn.codesignal.com/</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Free, limited use per day.</li>
  <li>Cosmo+: ($24.99/month) adds unlimited use, personalized skills paths, skills 
profile, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>CodeSignal originally provided testing and interviewing services for hiring coders, 
then added educational content. The resulting Learn site is kind of a mix between 
Duolingo sites and Show-and-Type sites: Each lesson page is a show-and-type page, 
but each time you submit your code to be checked, you lose one “heart”. Even if 
your code was perfect. (You lose more if you ask the AI for advice.) It takes a 
whole day for the hearts to fully regenerate. This means that, if you don’t pay 
for a plan, you can only take 5 actions per day. Period. The lessons are pretty 
good (and themed!) and it does validate your code after each step, but the free 
level is so limited that the site’s value is pretty limited, to me. It might be 
great if I pay $25/month, but I will probably never know. Still, it has some
paths that other sites do not.</p>

<p><strong>Paths include:</strong> Introduction to Programming with Python, 
Data Analysis 101 with R, Intro to Data Analysis with Python, Journey into 
SQL with Taylor Swift (yes, that’s its name!), Fundamental Coding Interview 
Preparation with C++, Introduction to COBOL and Mainframe Programming (!), 
Fundamental Coding Interview Preparation with Python, Introduction to Dart 
for Beginners, Mastering Algorithms and Data Structures in Python, Python 
Programming for Beginners, Mastering Algorithms and Data Structures in 
JavaScript, JavaScript Programming for Beginners, and tons more, many of them 
not easily found elsewhere.</p>

<div id="bubble">
<h3 class="pixelify">FreeCodeCamp, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Free. Like the name says.</li>
  <li>Did I say that it’s free? It’s free. Though they will show some ads asking 
for donations. But still: FREE!</li>
</ul>

<p>Coding bootcamps are a great option for some people, but they can be EX. PEN. SIVE. 
Like, grad school-level expensive. FreeCodeCamp was formed to get around that. 
You can take a ton of courses and get free verified certificates. Older courses 
(still available on the site) seem to have been video lectures, but the newer 
one I’m taking (Responsive Web Design) is a show-and-type course with lots of 
elaborate step-by-step interactive tutorials. It’s really well-designed, and 
although I taught web design for a long time, I’m finding quite a few things in 
there that I didn’t know (because they are newer techniques, mostly). You can even 
get at least one free professional Microsoft certification in C#. 
I highly recommend FreeCodeCamp.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the certifications:</strong> Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and 
  Data Science, Front End Development Libraries, Data Visualization, Relational 
  Database, Back End Development and APIs, Quality Assurance… and more. Additionally, 
  they have courses to prepare for developer interviews.</p>

  <h2>Classes. Like, traditional classes. But online.</h2>
  
  <p class="plain">This leads me to online courses that aren’t cute button-tapping apps with <em>kawaii</em> 
  mascots, or show-and-type apps: courses that are the equivalent of high school or 
  college classes. There are a ton of these, some offered through universities, 
  some elsewhere, like Udemy. It’s worth researching them. But there are some I 
  want to mention.</p>
  
  <p class="plain">EdX and Coursera have a bunch of these courses and full programs, mostly offered 
  by legit universities. Both sites have free auditing of their courses, but to get 
  certificates you have to pay.</p>
  
  <p class="intro">I especially want to mention something from EdX, though: CS50.</p>
<div id="bubble">
  <h3 class="pixelify">CS50 courses</h3>
  
  <p>CS50 is an introductory computer science course from Harvard, which is the 
    largest course on campus, and now the largest course on EdX. I was in the first 
    cohort of CS50 ten years ago, but never finished due to real world life stuff 
    interfering. (Divorces suck, I tell you…)  But the course was GREAT. Lectures, 
    exercises, problem sets, and a lot of hard work, but I *learned* so much while 
    I was there. I have always wanted to get back to it. I decided now is the time.</p> 
    
    <p>But what did I find when I looked into it?</p>
    
    <p>CS50 has become an entire ecosystem of courses, with free certificates 
      available as well as paid, verified certificates. These are the current 
      CS50 courses available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CS50x - the original</li>
  <li>CS50 AI</li>
  <li>CS50 Business</li>
  <li>CS50 Cybersecurity</li>
  <li>CS50 for Lawyers</li>
  <li>CS50 Games</li>
  <li>CS50 Python</li>
  <li>CS50 R</li>
  <li>CS50 Scratch</li>
  <li>CS50 SQL</li>
  <li>CS50 Technology</li>
  <li>CS50 Web</li>
</ul>

<p>All can be taken for free, completely, through Harvard’s OpenCourseWare. 
<a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/">https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/</a> gets 
you to the main CS50x page, and look near the bottom of the left side menu to find 
links to all the other courses. Follow the very well-defined steps to complete the 
course and get a free CS50 Certificate. If you want the verified cert, you’ll also 
have to enroll in EdX’s version of the same course, but it’s all explained clearly 
on the CourseWare page.</p>

<p>Now, the thing about the EdX cert is that you have to pay $$ for that one. 
  But... <em>If you are in the US</em>, you can sign up for <a href="https://partnerships.edx.org/verizon?&utm_source=vsf_v_citizen-verizon">Verizon 
  Skill Forward</a>, which is a 12-month scholarship to certain EdX courses, including 
  all of the CS50 courses. Including... all of the verified certificates if you 
  finish the courses successfully.  FREE.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p class="plain">So there you go. There are a lot of other options out there, but if you are 
  trying to put together a self-guided coding education, these should be helpful. 
  I am currently working through every single one of the items I listed here, 
  except for Codecademy. I may end up dropping some as I learn which ones are most 
  valuable, but for now, every day I do at least something on every one of these 
  sites/apps. </p>
  <p class="plain">Have you tried any of these? Tell me what you think!<br />
